I want the table of 'Reorders' to fetch the data from the Firebase/Firestore and display them as following:
- Image — the image of the part whose url is in the `image` document field in the `parts` subcollection
- Type — the name of the part from `name` document field in the `parts` subcollection
- Reorder Date — the data at which the reorder is reordered from `timestamp` document field in the `reorders` subcollection but with this format '06/05/2025'
- Price  — the name of the part from `price` document field in the `parts` subcollection
- Quantity  — the name of the part from `quantity` document field in the `reorders` subcollection which represents the number of parts reordered in the reorder
- Description — the name of the part from `quantity` document field in the `reorders` subcollection which represents the number of parts reordered in the reorder
